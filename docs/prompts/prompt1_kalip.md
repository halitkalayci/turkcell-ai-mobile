Goal

Design and scaffold a production-grade Flutter frontend project for mini e-commerce system. It MUST strictly follow Contract-First, SSOT
and layered architecture principles.

Scope

1- Project Initialization
2- Architecture & Layering
3- Type System & SSOT
4- Baseline Infrastructure
5- Quality Guardrails

Constraints

1- PLAN FIRST, DO NOT GENERATE ANY CODE
2- NO INVENTING:
   - API endpoints
   - Business Rules
3- Dependencies:
    - Do NOT add new dependencies without explict approval.

Decision
1- Decide ONLY
   - Flutter folder structure
   - Layer responsibilities
   - Baseline setup

2- NOT DECIDE:
   - Business Logic
   - Feature Behavior
   - API Semantic

3- If a decision is ambiguous:
   - STOP
   - Ask a clear, minimal clarificiation question

Output Format
- File Breakdown
- Open Questions (if any)
- If you have any recommendation to refactor AGENTS.md after this implementation with global rules, please suggest.
