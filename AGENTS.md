## 1) HOW TO WORK (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)

### 1.1) CODE GENERATION POLICY

- Always plan first, generation second.

- Always propose a file breakdown (what files will be created/changed) and wait for an approval.

### 1.2) SMALL BATCH RULE

- Generate maximum of 5 files if strongly coupled. DO NOT proceed with next batches without explict approval for current batch.

### 1.3) COMMENT STRATEGY

- Comment only where intent is non-obvious.

- DO NOT add comments on every line, only summary for functions/classes.
